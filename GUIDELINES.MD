1.  Make sure you have the latest version of main branch.  

1.   Read this [Article](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) about Markdown.  

1.   Add the company STRICTLY in the increasing alphabetical order. See this small [article](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3540681?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid).  

1.   Please don't add the numbering in logical order. Keep every number equal to ```1```. Markdown handles the numbering on its own.
